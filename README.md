# Correspondence-wise Losses

We propose to align images _before_ calculating a loss and optimizing in image generation tasks. Instead of calculating losses pixel-wise we calculate them _correspondence-wise_. Correspondence-wise losses offers greater robustness to spatial uncertainty and a more informative gradient signal.

## Getting Started

### Download Flow Model Checkpoints

First, download the flow model checkpoints by running `sh download_models.sh`. This will download the RAFT checkpoints and copy them to the correct directory, and then do some cleanup.

### Wrapper

Our method is implemented as a wrapper that wraps around a base loss function. As an example, we can wrap an L1 loss as such:

```python
base_loss = nn.L1Loss()
loss = CorrWise(base_loss)
```

In addition, various parameters can be passed to the wrapper to specify different behavior. Details can be found in the docstring of `CorrWise`. A typical use case would be:

```python
base_loss = nn.L1Loss()
loss = CorrWise(base_loss, 
                backward_warp=True, 
                return_warped=False, 
                padding_mode='reflection',
                scale_clip=.1)
```

Please see `example.py` for a short, working example.

## Replicating our Experiments

### Run experiments

Config files for our experiments are located in `./experiments/` and can be run by calling

```
python train.py --config [path to config file]
```

### Evaluate 

```
python test.py --config [path to config file]
```

## TODO

 - [ ] Standardized data loading. Right now there are multiple dataloaders, loading video sequences in a variety of formats.
 - [ ] Write scripts to download data and put them in the correct format and directory structure.
 - [ ] Write script to download raft-things.pth into `flow_models/raft` dir
